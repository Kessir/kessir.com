AWS Cloud Development Kit is a tool that allows you to define your AWS infrastructure in a programming language such as Typescript instead of Yaml or Json files. It currently supports `TypeScript`, `Python`, `.NET`, `Java`. 

## Why AWS Cloud Development Kit
I was recently tasked with migrating our modest cloud infrastructure to Amazon Web Service.
I learned about the different AWS services we would need and started setting them up manually in the developer console. This was exciting the first few times as it allowed trial and errors.
It however quickly became repetitive. I probably set up ECS services more than 30 times. 
It was not only repetitive but also not reproducible. If I had to set it up again I would probably mess up a few times.

I knew the solution to this problem was the concept of `Infrastructure-as-Code` but I found tools such as Terraform intimidating and overkill for our simple set up.
I then came across AWS Cloud Development Kit which was launched in 2019.
